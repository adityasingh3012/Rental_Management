// Authentication Endpoints
POST /api/auth/login          // User login
POST /api/auth/register       // User registration
POST /api/auth/forgot-password // Password reset request
POST /api/auth/reset-password  // Password reset confirmation
PUT  /api/auth/profile        // Update user profile
```

#### Demo Credentials
The system includes demo credentials for testing:
- **Admin**: admin@rental.com / admin123
- **Staff**: staff@rental.com / staff123
- **Customer**: customer@rental.com / customer123

#### Key Technologies Used
- React with TypeScript
- React Hook Form for form management
- React Router v6 for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Context API for state management

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Features

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Try the demo credentials on the login page
4. Explore the different user role dashboards
5. Test the registration flow
6. Try the forgot password functionality
7. Update profile information

The authentication system provides a solid, professional foundation for the entire rental management application!
