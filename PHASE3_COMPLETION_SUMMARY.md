## üéØ Next Steps

Phase 3 is now complete! The application now has:

1. **Complete API Service Layer**: All backend endpoints are ready for integration
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for all API operations
3. **Consistent Architecture**: Modular, maintainable service structure
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and endpoints

**Ready for Phase 4**: Authentication & Routing implementation can now begin, using the services created in this phase.

## üìö Usage Examples

```typescript
// Import services
import { authService, productService, rentalService } from '../services';

// Authentication
const user = await authService.login({ email, password });

// Product management
const products = await productService.getProducts({ category: 'electronics' });

// Rental operations
const rental = await rentalService.createRental(quotationId, rentalData);
```

All services are now ready for use in components and pages!
